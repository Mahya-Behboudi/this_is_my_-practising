With the crude loop we have now where it just cycles as quickly as it can,
 two factors determine the frame rate. The first is how much work it has to do each frame.
  Complex physics, a bunch of game objects, and lots of graphic detail all will keep
   your CPU and GPU busy, and it will take longer to complete a frame.

The second is the speed of the underlying platform.
 Faster chips churn through more code in the same amount of time.
  Multiple cores, GPUs, dedicated audio hardware, and the OSâ€™s scheduler
   all affect how much you get done in one tick.
